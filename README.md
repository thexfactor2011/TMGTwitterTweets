Twitter Tweeting Code Challenge

## Assumptions
1. Tweets do not need to persist after app close
1. This app was made during off hours of having a full time job, a family, and travel 8 hours for Easter weekend. If you want a more robust fun app, just allow me a little more time.
1. You have to supply your own Twitter API key. Update the buildConfig with your keys.
1. For simplicity I request a new Twitter AuthToken after every app restart. In a real app it would be stored and refreshed.

## Notes
1. Twitter's documentation is terrible.
